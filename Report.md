## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use data from a non-profit charity (Alphabet Soup) to determine if a model can be identified that will predict if applicants will be successfully funded.
A CSV file containing over 34,000 organisations that have received funding and whether the funding was successfully used. 
The data was processed using three steps :

1. Preprocessing of Data
Scikit-learn was used to apply the standardScaler method along with the transform function. Prior to this the data was examined and the target variable identified along with the variables for the features of the model.  

2. Compile, Train and evaluate the model


3. Optimise the Model
